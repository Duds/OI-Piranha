# OI-Piranha
Open Inspired Piranha, an open source quadcopter design.

## Welcome to OI Piranha
I started OI Pirahna a bit by accident. I was trying to build the [DJI Inspired Version 1.5](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2399740) and the leadscrew I ordered arrived with a two start nut and a four start screw. I had some time to spare that I was planning to assemble my quad and so instead I sat down at my computer and wondered how hard it would be to design and print a four start nut for the leadscrew I had. As it happens 3d printing a four start nut won't work, the threads are too fine, for my printer anyway. So I designed a much larger leadscrew that would allow me to print a much larger nut. And then I thought this is silly, why am I copying a thread standard when I can design my own thread, with my own pitch and my own lead. Then, I thought hang on I don't even need a 360 degree continuos servo and top and bottom limit switches. All I need is a normal servo and I'll design the leadscrew to lift the body using the normal throw of the servo. Then I needed to know what the normal lift length was so I could design a leadscrew that would lift the body in 90 degrees. 

Many hours later, and I had roughly redesigned most of the aircraft frame. I had also viewed a stack of youtube videos on Fusion 360 design and learned a lot about top down design, the Fusion 360 timeline and a whole pile of stuff about 3d modelling.

When I was finished that first rough draft on my first night cram session I stood back and took a look at the frame and lift mechanism I had designed. I hadn't started on a fairing then. For some reason, the lump back where the battery goes and stubby little snout where the gimbal frame is reminded me of a fat stubby angry little predator fish. Not the lean fast fish like a tuna, but something maneuverable, still pretty fast, but much shorter and more agile. I went online to find out what kind of predator fish was short fat stubby and nasty. I found a photo of Piranha. I knew straight away that is what I had designed, a Piranha. And so I copied the photo of the pirahna in as a canvas and started work on my fairing.

##Warning -- under design
You are very welcome to make a fork of this design and to download the parts and print them. However, please be aware, this design is still a work in progress. Parts may not fit, or may break in use. Things may change and different versions of parts may not be compatible with versions of parts that you have printed. You might need to print things multiple times or find that parts fail during printing. All these challenges mean that, for now, the responsibility of starting and finishing an OI Piranha is not small. If you do take on the job your feedback is valued. Send your feedback good and bad to [Dale](mailto://hello@dalerogers.com.au)

##Credits
The Pirahna wouldn't exist if there weren't other DJI Inspired quadcopters before mine.
The first DJI Inspired was designed by [BlackBox RC](http://www.blackboxrc.co.uk/)
The BlackBox RC DJI Inspired was then modified, as the DJI Inspired v1.5 by Fragmaster on [RCGroups](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2399740)

Fragmaster was substantially supported during design by feedback and contributions from:
[Helifrek](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2330047),
[Mr.RCCAM](http://www.rc-cam.com/),
RTRyder, and
Many other contributors at [RCGroups](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2399740)

You can also find Thingiverse makes of the [BlackBox RC DJI Inspire](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:593132) and, the [Fragmaster DJI Inspired V1.5](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:909384)

I humbly apologise if you have contributed to the development of the DJI Inspired family of 3d printed quadcopters and you think you deserve mention. Please drop me an email at hello@dalerogers.com.au and I will correct the oversight. 

Those credited above have contributed to a great design, but all errors are mine.
