The Pirahna design is supported by feedback from @whitedrag0n, @corwest and @stanv

The Pirahna wouldn't exist if there weren't other DJI Inspired quadcopters before mine. The first DJI Inspired was designed by BlackBox RC The BlackBox RC DJI Inspired was then modified, as the DJI Inspired v1.5 by Fragmaster on RCGroups

Fragmaster was substantially supported during design by feedback and contributions from: Helifrek, Mr.RCCAM, RTRyder, VladMiami, and many other contributors at RCGroups

You can also find Thingiverse makes of the BlackBox RC DJI Inspire and, the Fragmaster DJI Inspired V1.5

I humbly apologise if you have contributed to the development of the DJI Inspired family of 3d printed quadcopters and you have not been mentioned. Please drop me an email at hello@dalerogers.com.au and I will correct the oversight.

Those credited above have contributed to a great design, but all errors are mine.
